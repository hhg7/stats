# Cross-validation of seq() against R's base::seq().
#
# seq() is not the one-line loop it looks like.  R's version is a chain of
# eight special cases -- two different fuzz factors, three ways to end up
# with a single value, a rewrite for endpoints whose difference overflows,
# and a clamp on the last element -- and every one of them decides either how
# many values come back or where the sequence stops.  A plain
# (to - from)/by loop, which is what this module shipped up to 0.314, agrees
# with R on seq(1, 5) and disagrees on a surprising amount else.  So the
# cases below are R's own, not invented here.
#
# Provenance:
#
#   * R 4.6.1 tests/reg-tests-1a.R, the "## seq" block (moved there from
#     seq.Rd): seq(3,3,by=pi) and seq(3,3.1,by=pi) are both the single value
#     3, seq(1,6,by=3) is c(1,4), and seq(10,4.05,by=-3) is c(10,7).
#   * R 4.6.1 tests/reg-tests-1a.R, "Don MacQueen 2002-03-26":
#     length(seq(1024902010, 1024902025, by=1)) == 16.
#   * R 4.6.1 tests/reg-tests-1a.R, the "## Round" block, whose sample is
#     seq(-2, 4, by = 0.5).
#   * R 4.6.1 tests/reg-tests-1b.R, "(Deliberate) overshot in
#     seq(from, to, by) because of fuzz": every value of
#     seq(0, 1, 0.00025+5e-16) must be <= 1.  It overshot by about 2e-12 in
#     R 2.8.x and stopped short of 1 in 2.11.0; the clamp on the last
#     element, added in R 2.9.0, is what makes it land.
#   * R 4.6.1 tests/reg-tests-2.R, "seq() with NaN etc inputs now gives
#     explicit error messages": seq(NaN), seq(to = NaN), seq(NaN, NaN).
#   * R 4.6.1 src/library/base/man/seq.Rd \examples: seq(1, 9, by = 2)
#     ("matches 'end'"), seq(1, 9, by = pi) ("stays below 'end'"),
#     seq(1, 6, by = 3), seq(1.575, 5.125, by = 0.05).
#   * R 4.6.1 base::seq.default() itself for the frozen tables, generated at
#     %.17g by t/seq.R.R, which is committed next to this file; re-run that
#     script to regenerate them.  The remaining cases there are chosen to
#     reach the branches of seq.default() the citations above do not: the
#     absent-'by' route (from:to) in both directions, the four ways to a
#     single value, a subnormal step, and the (to - from) overflow rewrite.
#
# Python has no equivalent to cross-check against, which is why there is no
# t/seq.R.numpy.t.  numpy.arange() is half-open and carries no fuzz, so
# arange(0, 1, 0.1) is ten values ending at 0.9 where seq(0, 1, 0.1) is
# eleven ending at 1; numpy.linspace() and range() are parameterised by
# length, which is R's seq(length.out=) and not this function.  Both were
# checked (NumPy 2.5.2 numpy/_core/tests/test_multiarray.py TestArange,
# SciPy 1.18.0 has nothing of its own) before concluding it.
#
# Where this deliberately differs from R, and why, is asserted in section H
# rather than left for someone to discover.

# The tables are R's doubles.  A plain double perl reproduces them bit for
# bit, because the arithmetic is the same two operations in the same order:
# the diag() at the end reports a worst relative disagreement of exactly 0 on
# perl-5.44.0 and perl-5.42.3.  The other builds cannot, and not because the
# arithmetic is worse -- because it is done on a different number.  A
# long-double or __float128 perl parses "0.05" to its own NV, half an ulp of
# a double away from what R read, and one multiply and one add carry that
# through; an x87 build keeps the product in an 80-bit register.  So the
# comparison is toleranced rather than exact, and the tolerance is measured
# rather than chosen:
#
#   perl-5.44.0, perl-5.42.3   (double)               0
#   perl-5.10.1                (double)               1.11e-16
#   perl-5.44.0+x87            (double, 80-bit regs)  1.60e-16
#   perl-5.12.5                (long double)          1.50e-16
#   5.44.0-quadmath            (__float128)           1.50e-16
#
# 8e-16 is a little over 3 * DBL_EPSILON, five times the worst of those.  It
# is a bound on one rounding of the step plus one of the product, so it does
# not need to grow with the length of the sequence, and it must not be
# widened to make a failure go away: a real disagreement with R here would
# be a whole ulp of the step times the index, which is orders of magnitude
# larger than this.
my $REL = 8e-16;

# Lengths are integer counts and must agree exactly on every build, and they
# do, because no count here sits near the boundary R's truncation puts it on.
# Half the cases have an n = (to-from)/by that is exactly integral and are
# built from dyadic literals, so n is the same number at every NV width and
# the 1e-10 is pure margin.  Of the genuinely fuzzy ones the tightest is
# seq(0,1,0.00025+5e-16): n is 3999.9999999920, 7.9e-9 short of the 4000 that
# would add a twelve-thousandth value, where the most a wider NV can move it
# is about n * DBL_EPSILON, or 9e-13.  Four orders of magnitude of headroom.
